Set the total to 0 to start with.
While the total is 50 or less,
ask the user to input a number.
Add that number to the total and print the message
“The total is… [total]”.
Stop the loop when the total is over 50.

Define a subprogram that will ask the user to pick a low and a high number,
and then generate a random number between those two values and store it
in a variable called “comp_num”.
Define another subprogram that will give the instruction “I am thinking of a number…”
and then ask the user to guess the number they are thinking of.
Define a third subprogram that will check to see if the comp_num is the same as the user’s guess.
If it is, it should display the message “Correct, you win”,
otherwise it should keep looping,
telling the user if they are too low or too high and asking them to guess again until they guess correctly.

"""
Create a program that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names.
You should display a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list,
change a name in the list,
delete a name from the list or view all the names in the list.
There should also be a menu option to allow the user to end the program.
If they select an option that is not relevant,
then it should display a suitable message.
After they have made a selection to either add a name,
change a name, delete a name or view all the names,
they should see the menu again without having to restart the program.
The program should be made as easy to use as possible.
